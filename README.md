# VIRA_beg_classifier
project aim: develop a classifier able to identify the begging calls of Virginia rail juveniles with the goal of localizing begging calls to understand fine-scale habitat association

# Test Data
This classifier will be applied to the rail localization dataset (internal code: rloc) which consists of two years (2024 & 2025) of acoustic monitoring at between 31-36 points in a fresh water marsh within State Game lands 213 in Pymatuning, PA. Synced data can be found @screech:/users/brg226/projects/rloc/datasets. 

# Training Data
Training data consist of 22 audio files from the Macaulay Library, a review of the 22 files exists here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10OEAbiGLQ_u31SaryqvKON4S-FgtsCyDfvu9CJIXI-4/edit?gid=0#gid=0
Annotated clips can be found on my local machine at /Users/brookegoodman/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofPittsburgh/Desktop/rloc/VIRA_beg/boxed_audio. File names correspond to the MC Library ID, and selection tables are named after the MC Library ID with the extention .txt.
